## About CL Inventory

The cl Inventory was written using Laravel for faster implementation. Started on the day 14/10/2025 and the process of development was the following: database, models, middlewares, api and frontend, further implementations and changes are not in view. The api supports session based authentication to prevent api keys being used on the web browser as also to ease the development of the frontend by using csrf tokens.
